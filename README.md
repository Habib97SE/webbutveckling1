# My project in webbutveckling 1 (D0015D) course at Luleå Tekniska Högskola (Spring semester 2021)

During this project, I used different techniques based on ONLY HTML5 & CSS3 to get things fixed.

The project is an online e-commerce where the targets are people who study at unviersity or high school level who want to buy course litteratur books. 

there are 5 different pages:
  1) Home Page: The main page of the project, where most users visit it first.
  2) Category page: Where all products inside a particular category will be shown. 
  3) Product page: Every product has a particular page where all available info about the product will be shown (in my case all info about book, like imag of front page, description, title, author(s) and etc..). 
  4) Contact us page: A simple page where people can use a form submission in order to come in contact with the e-commerce provider. 
  5) About us page: Where we write shortly about our history, plans for foture and etc. 
 
This project might be update time to time.
